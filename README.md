# airline-fuel-manager

This is a tool for use by an airline to plan where a plane should refuel along its route. A user selects the plane, base airport and several destination airports. The program will then calculate the amount of fuel required to fly each leg of the route and how much fuel should be bought at each airport. The planeâ€™s performance attributes can be altered to reflect different conditions.
